I might be the first serious one out of all of these people but here we go.\n\nBack when this mod first started we barely had a team, we built this mod and made it something good. I’m glad I get to put my name in these credits and get famous WOOHOO!\n\nIn all seriousness though, thanks for the opportunity to be where I am in this community today. Sure I might be known as the funkin.avi dude for the rest of my time here, but I’ve grown to not be ashamed of that title. Without these people on the team this mod would’ve went NOWHERE, so I appreciate these talented creators joining the team. That being said, I cannot wait to share more Dunkin funkin projects with you guys, as this is just the beginning. There is so much more to come. And as for funkin.avi, there is so much more to this story.\n\nThank you so much for playing, and supporting us on this journey to COMPLETE FUNKIN.AVI!!!

is insane. I remember obsessing over the mod somewhere back in 2022 when the first demo released, which also motivated me to start modding on my own. I met my best friend Yama, and also met my goats Grey, Niko, Notice, and others. Thank you guys. I love you all. (no homo, at least not with my friends)
Hope you enjoy the mod and have fun playing  what the team made! We're incredibly proud of our efforts finally being done.. for now at least. :3
